# bracketatcha
MxPx albums face off against each other.

I wanted to create a clickable bracket, so this is my first attempt.

These are my project goals:

  1. Make the bracket clickable all the way through the GOAT or final winner.
  2. Add an option to export or "share" the bracket as a .jpeg.
  3. Use the template for other bands.
  4. Add a dropdown at the top to choose which band (MxPx, blink-182, Sum 41, Green Day, Relient K).
